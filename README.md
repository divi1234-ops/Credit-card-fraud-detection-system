# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Overview

This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection System using machine learning techniques. The aim is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions and minimize financial losses for banks and customers. The system analyzes transaction data and predicts the likelihood of fraud in real-time.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares transaction data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts relevant features to improve model accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes algorithms such as Logistic Regression.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measures performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Visualization:** Provides graphical insights into the data and model results.
- **Deployment:** Can be integrated into banking systems for real-time fraud detection.

## Dataset

The system uses a publicly available dataset of credit card transactions, which includes both genuine and fraudulent transactions.

## Usage

- Place your transaction data in the `data/` folder.
- Configure the parameters in `config.py` (if available).
- Execute `main.py` to train and evaluate the models.
- Review results and visualizations in the `output/` folder.

## Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression

## can also use 
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Networks (optional/advanced)

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC
