# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Overview

This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection System using machine learning techniques. The aim is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions and minimize financial losses for banks and customers. The system analyzes transaction data and predicts the likelihood of fraud in real-time.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares transaction data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts relevant features to improve model accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measures performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Visualization:** Provides graphical insights into the data and model results.
- **Deployment:** Can be integrated into banking systems for real-time fraud detection.

## Dataset

The system uses a publicly available dataset of credit card transactions, which includes both genuine and fraudulent transactions. Sensitive information is anonymized for privacy.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divi1234-ops/Credit-card-fraud-detection-system.git
   cd Credit-card-fraud-detection-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Place your transaction data in the `data/` folder.
- Configure the parameters in `config.py` (if available).
- Execute `main.py` to train and evaluate the models.
- Review results and visualizations in the `output/` folder.
